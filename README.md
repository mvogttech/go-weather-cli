## A Simple Weather CLI

After being tired of going to different weather sources / websites filled with ads, I decided to create a simplistic free-to-use weather forecast report that I could access right in my terminal.

### Where Does The Information Come From?

The weather forecast originates from weather.gov's public free-to-use API. Meaning this software will be free and accessible to anyone.
